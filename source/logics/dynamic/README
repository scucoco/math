This directory hosts MMT/LATIN formalizations of dynamic logics.

currently:

propdynlog.mmt     propositional dynamic logic (after Pratt 76).

We want to eventually develop
- the logic graph of dynamic logics for program verification up to KIV
- the dynamic logics for computational NL semantics (DRT, DPL, DMG, DLC, ...)
