Categories are used as models interpreting objects as types and proofs as morphisms (Curry-Howard correspondence). Such models were introduced in

The present encodings comprise intuitionistic and classical propositional logic, modal logic (S4), and linear logic. Monoidal comonads are used to represent modal and linear logic.

Categories are formalized in dependently-typed first-order logic (DFOL). Categories use an ordering on each Hom-set to model proof rewriting, and a distinguished object to model the least designated truth value.
