General structure of current directory at
https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/twelf/logics/first-order

Subdirectories are

/model_theory
/proof_theory
/soundness
/syntax
 
Each subdirectory contains encodings of sorted and unsorted first-order logic:

- for first-order logic

base.elf    - signatures with auxiliary declarations and definitions
modules.elf - separate signatures for the syntax/proof-theory/model-theory of first-order quantifiers and equality
fol.elf     - signatures collecting individual signatures for logical symbols together

- for sorted first-order logic
sorted_base.elf    - signatures with auxiliary declarations and definitions
sorted_modules.elf - separate signatures for the syntax/proof-theory/model-theory of first-order quantifiers and equality
sorted.elf         - signatures collecting individual signatures for logical symbols together
