MMT flattening produces several errors:

1) When mapping structures to a morphism M, MMT infers aliases for the generated constants from the aliases given by M.
   Twelf does not do that.
   The infered aliases will clash because they are also generated when flattening M.

2) Nested theories: http://latin.omdoc.org/logics/proof_theory?IFOL?Classical is not produced by Twelf

3) MMT signals clashes between implicit morphisms even though those can be shown to be equal.
   These go from LF to some theory T and are induced by an implicit structure in T (http://latin.omdoc.org/math?RingUnitLogic?ring or http://latin.omdoc.org/foundations/type_theory/church?KindsTypesTerms?*).
   
4) Certain operations lead to "retrieval failed" errors
